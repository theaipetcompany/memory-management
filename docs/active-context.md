   - Similarity search using cosine similarity (JavaScript implementation)
   - Interaction tracking and management
   - Type-safe database operations with proper error handling

    - Validation functions for data integrity
    - Constants for embedding dimensions and thresholds
    - Type-safe enums for relationship types and interaction types

11. **Database Migration**

12. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
    - Type validation tests (`types/memory.test.ts`) - âœ… **PASSING (31/31 tests)**
    - Database operation tests (`lib/memory-database.test.ts`) - ðŸ”„ **Mock setup needs refinement**
    - All TypeScript compilation errors resolved âœ…

#### ðŸ”„ Current Limitations

1. **Job Management**: No real-time job status tracking or monitoring
2. **Configuration Panel**: No model selection or training parameters UI
3. **Data Validation**: Basic validation, could be more comprehensive
4. **Test Mocking**: Prisma mock setup needs refinement for database tests

#### âœ… Fixed: Recognition Testing Issue

**Problem**: "Recognition Results" always showed "No matching faces found in memory"
**Root Cause**: Mock embeddings used deterministic hash-based generation, different images produced different embeddings
**Solution**: Implemented consistent test embeddings that ensure same image always produces same embedding for reliable testing

### Required Memory Management Features

Based on research, the following features are needed for complete OpenAI vision fine-tuning:

#### Data Format Requirements

- **JSONL Format**: Each line must be a JSON object with `messages` array
- **Image Support**: Images as base64 data URIs or public URLs
- **Size Limits**: Max 50,000 examples, 64 images per example, 10MB per image
- **Format Support**: JPEG, PNG, WEBP in RGB/RGBA mode

#### Missing GUI Components Needed

1. **Image Preview Component**

   - Display uploaded images in the table
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Image validation feedback

2. **JSONL Export/Preview**

   - Show generated training data format
   - Validate against OpenAI requirements
   - Download functionality

3. **Job Management Dashboard**

   - Real-time job status tracking
   - Progress monitoring
   - Error handling and retry options

4. **Configuration Panel**

   - Model selection (gpt-4o-2024-08-06)
   - Training parameters
   - Validation settings

5. **File Storage Integration**
